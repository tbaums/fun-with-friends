## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-05

First tagged release.

### Added
- **`fwf` launcher** — point it at a git repo and it stands up the 8-pane tmux
  swarm. `start`/`init` clone a URL (or adopt a local path), detect the
  toolchain, show the inferred commands for review, scaffold a profile, provision
  worktrees, and launch. Plus `provision`, `up`, `attach`, `respawn`, `stop`,
  `resume`, `down`, `doctor`, `version`, `profiles`, `help`.
- **Ecosystem auto-detection** (`lib/detect.sh`) for Rust, Node
  (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun), Go, and Python — proposing gate/build/e2e/dev commands,
  with Playwright/Cypress and typecheck/lint awareness.
- **Profile generation** (`lib/profile.sh`) with a fail-closed gate when the
  ecosystem is unknown, so QA never silently merges on an undetected repo.
- **Per-repo workspace** under `~/.fun-with-friends/workspaces/<name>` so eight
  worktrees stay out of `$HOME`.
- **bash 3.2 floor guard** (the scripts are 3.2-clean, so macOS's stock bash
  works) and a `doctor` preflight for tmux/git/gh/claude.
- **Functional test suite** (`test/run.sh`, 42 checks) and CI: lint
  (`shellcheck -S warning` + `bash -n`) plus the suite on Linux and macOS, and a
  tag-driven release workflow that packages a generic tarball.
- **TEAM LEAD orchestrator prompt** (`prompts/lead.tmpl`) — the interactive role
  the human drives the project from.
- MIT license, release runbook (`RELEASING.md`), and an URL-first README.
